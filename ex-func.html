			<h1>Executive Functions</h1>
			<h6>Written By I. P. Daily</h6>

			<h2>Task Initiation</h2>
			<p>When you're trying to do your homework and you decide that it would be more appealing
			to watch people fall in swimming pools on YouTube but you complete the homework anyway,
			this is called task initiation. 
			</p><p>
			The basic defenition of task intiation is to be able to get a task done without 
			procrastinating. This can be hard to do, especially if you don't want to do the task at
			hand. Task initiation is helpful, because in the long run you'll have more time to watch
			YouTube than have to finish overdue assignments.
			</p><p>
			Now, how can I get better at task initiation? You ask. Well, there are a few practices that
			can really help you to stay on track with your tasks. You can break down the assignment 
			into smaller pieces, set a plan for what you want to get done on each day, and have the 
			incentive of "if I get this done, then I can do this". If you practice this frequently, 
			you will find yourself getting more things done on time.
			</p><br/>

			<h2>Response Inhibition</h2>
			<p>If you ever blurt out randomly in class or do things without thinking about it, then
			you probably don't have the best response inhibition scores.
			</p><p>
			Response inhibition means that you have control over yourself and you think before you act.
			This can help you by not making stupid decisions that could get you in big trouble. Like
			task initiation, response inhibition can help you get your homework done. If there is a
			distraction, you would stay focused on the task that needs to be done. Not only does it
			help with distractions, it helps you to be more patient with siblings, not blurting out in
			the middle of class, etc.
			</p><p>
			Response inhibition is very useful, and you should learn this sooner rather than later. To
			get better at this, you can:
			<ol>
				<li>Ask your teacher to put you towards the front of the class</li>
				<li>Put some thought into what you say</li>
				<li>Ask your teacher to set explicit rules so you know what to follow exactly</li>
			</ol>
			Response inhibition can help you to become a socially and academically better person.
			</p><br/>

			<h2>Flexibility</h2>
			<p>If your parents have ever changed plans last second and you had no idea about it but you
			go with the flow and don't get angry or anything, you are mentally flexible.
			</p><p>
			Basically, being flexible means that you just go with the flow and whatever happens you are
			ready for. For example, you are ready for the next task, you are engaged and participating
			in class, and you let the old stuff go. Flexibility makes you a better social person overall
			because you become a pretty chill person and are happy with most things.
			</p><p>
			If you feel like you aren't flexible, don't worry. There are numerous ways you can get 
			better. You can give yourself a few moments of rest before switching between activities,
			you can use schedules to help learn routines, and you can ask your teacher to give you a 
			heads up between activities.
			</p><br/>

			<h2>Planning/Prioritizing</h2>
			<p>If you set and meet goals, you probably have a brain that likes to plan things, and is
			pretty organized. 
			</p><p>
			The executive function of planining means that you plan for things that might happen or that
			you need to get done. An example might be that you have a lot to do the next day and then		
			you make a plan for how you're going to get it all done.
			</p><p>
			If you feel like planning isn't your strong suit, then you might want to consider to break
			projects down into managable parts and then solve it from there, use reminders on your phone
			or something, and write plans for your day the night before. Planning is a very useful skill,
			and many sucessful people use it to suceed.
